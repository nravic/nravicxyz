Hey, my name is Niranjan Ravichandra. I'm currently a senior at SUNY Buffalo studying Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. I work in a few labs on campus, working on things ranging from machine learning and neuroevolution to satellite navigation and controls. I enjoy amateur olympic weightlifting, running, and jumping from hobby to hobby and interest to interest. 

I've been having trouble tracking all the stuff I get into; this blog should prove useful in that regard.
